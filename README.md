# Hello, my name is Juan Manuel Vallarino 👋

- 🖥 I’m currently working on my second SwiftUI app, I dont have a definitive name fot it but I want it to combine workout routines with nutrition. 
- 🔭 I’m currently learning everything I can about SwiftUI, mainly focusing on Core Data and JSON Parsing.
- 🏋️ My hobby besides coding is Powerlfiting. I compete locally and would like to compete internationally.
